# Projects
This repository contains some of the projects that I have made:

1. [12th-Std.-Computer-Science](https://github.com/kiner-shah/Projects/tree/master/12th-Std.-Computer-Science) is a project made using C++ to simulate a pharmacy store system. It uses certain OOPS concepts along with File Handling.
2. [Computer-Graphics](https://github.com/kiner-shah/Projects/tree/master/Computer-Graphics) contains a simple graphics animation of a "bouncing ball" which was made using C.
3. [Network-Programming-Laboratory](https://github.com/kiner-shah/Projects/tree/master/Network-Programming-Laboratory) contains a C program to simulate the working of a network tool "Ping". The project was aimed at designing a custom command which works the same way as Ping. The project however can only simulate two of the original Ping functionalities.
4. [Web-Technology](https://github.com/kiner-shah/Projects/tree/master/Web-Technology) contains two projects (two websites) which were made using different Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP and also database technologies like MySQL.
